# CustomerChurn-DL

CustomerChurn-DL is a deep learning project that uses customer data to predict the likelihood of customer churn. The project is designed to help businesses understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Project Overview
The CustomerChurn-DL project aims to predict the likelihood of customer churn using deep learning techniques. By analyzing customer data and identifying patterns, the project can help businesses understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and take proactive measures to retain customers. The project involves data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, deep learning model training and evaluation, and the creation of a predictive model.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## File Descriptions
- `CustomerChurn-DL.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, deep learning model training, and evaluation
- `customer_data.csv`: CSV file containing the customer data used for the project
- `Model_deployment/`: Folder containing the code for model deployment
- `Model_inference/`: Folder containing code for model inference testing

## Results
The CustomerChurn-DL project was able to successfully predict the likelihood of customer churn with an accuracy of 92%. The project identified the most important features that contribute to customer churn and created a predictive model that can be used to assess the risk of customer churn for future customer interactions. These insights can be used by businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Deployment
The `Model_deployment/` folder contains the code required for deploying the trained model in a production environment. The deployment code includes instructions for setting up the necessary infrastructure and integrating the model with a web application.

## Inference
The `Model_inference/` folder contains code for testing the deployed model and verifying that it is working as expected.
